# JavaScript Practice Repository 🚀

👋 Hi, I'm Ujjwal - a React developer with 3 years of experience, currently strengthening my fundamentals to prepare for technical interviews at top firms.

This repository not only documents my journey of solving **JavaScript Problems daily** but also exploring **behind-the-scenes concepts** like how the JS engine executes code. Each solution includes both the code and clear explanation of the logic. I also document insights gained from the lectures and resources here.
