# Day 05 - Given an integer age, determine if the person is eligible to vote

## Problem Statement

Write a function `isEligibleToVote(age)` that takes an integer `age` as input and returns `true` if the person is eligible to vote (age 18 or older), and `false` otherwise.

- Input must be a finite integer.
- Return false for non-integer inputs (e.g., strings, floats, objects, arrays).
- Return false for negative ages.
- Return false for NaN or infinite values.
- The voting age threshold is 18 years.
